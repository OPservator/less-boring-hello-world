# less-boring-hello-world

Just starting with Java, thought basic Hello World is way too boring and decided to put some life into it, just to get joy out of it.

Basic Hello World program using Java (Amazon Coretto 11 + InteliJ IDEA), but instead of Hello World, there are whole lyrics of actual Tenacious D's Belzeboss.
